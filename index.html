                  <h2>Destination</h2>
                  <p>In the spring of 2023, I had the honor of attending a 
                  wedding in the Dominican Republic. My boyfriend's cousin that he had grown 
                  up with since childhood was marrying his highschool sweetheart! On the day of the ceremony it actually rained,
                  and although that may immediately be seen as a bad thing, I've actually heard it means good luck for the couple. A couple of my favorite
                  reasons for rain bringing luck on the big day is that rain signifies the cleansing of bad memories on both sides, which leaves a clean slate for the 
                  foundation of the couple's marriage to be built on. Also, that it signals that the marriage will last. The reason being that when a tied knot gets wet 
                  it becomes extremely difficult to untie, so when you "tie the knot" on a rainy day, your marriage will be difficult to unravel!
                  All in all, it was a beautiful ceremony as well as a wonderful vacation. I am still incredibly grateful that we were able to attend and
                  celebrate their union, so I wanted to share some of the highlights.

                  <h2>Travel</h2>
                  <p> Having never been out of the country before this trip, I was glad for the travel planning help we received from the wedding coordinator. He took a lot of 
                     stress off by setting up the room reservations at the resort and arrangements for us to be taken to the resort once we landed at the Punta Cana airport.
                     All we had to do was send payment to the coordinator for the resort, and make sure that we had valid passports in hand before our departure.
                     
                     We used American Airlines to get both to and from the Dominican Republic. There were no flight delays and although we had a couple of connecting flights that had 
                     us bustling through the airport to get to the next gate, it was relatively stress free. We left the KCI airport at 6a on April 19th, caught a connecting flight in Chicago, and arrived
                     in Punta Cana at 4:45p. The only real kick in the pants we experienced that day was having to wait in the customs line for hours.
                  
                     Once we finally made it through the longest line of my life, we were ready to find the shuttle bus that would be taking us to our resort. The company was called Discova
                     and everyone that helped us so kind. If you've never been, outside of the Punta Cana airport there are a lot of people offering different services for things and some may even 
                     try to grab your bags for you and take them to your awaiting vehicle, but won't give them back until you pay them for their "services". Thankfully the Discova employees grabbed our bags
                     for us and moved so swiftly through the crowd that we didn't have to deal with that. At last, we were finally off to see what staying at a resort is all about!

                  <h2>Resort</h2>
                  <p>The resort that the wedding was being held at had 2 different accomodation options to choose from. There was a more expensive side that catered to adult couples and singles
                     called Secrets, but it cost quite a bit more. The second option was actually connected to the Secrets side and was focused more toward families, but had slightly different areas accessible to those who chose to stay there.
                     We stayed on this side, referred to as Dreams, and it was still quite nice! There was only restaurant that we weren't able to access and some areas of the grounds that were restricted for the guests who stayed in the Secrets rooms.
                     We had requested a King bed which was not guaranteed due to the size of the group going, and did end up with 2 Queen size beds instead but they were cozy.
                     There was a buffet with an assortment of food at breakfast, lunch, and dinner as well as a handful of restaurants with cuisine ranging from Hibachi to Rotisserie Chicken so there was something for everyone. My personal favorite was the 
                     beach hut that served cheese fries...in front of the ocean..talk about paradise!

                     The cermony was held in a large courtyard on the Secrets side, and although it rained, it was still beautiful. Mostly due to all the kind words, promises, and love that was being shared under the alter. I'd like to say there wasn't a dry eye 
                     in the house, but it was hard to tell through the tsunami in my eyes. Afterward, we all went to a private section of the Secrets beach for the reception. They had salmon, veggies, hollandaise sauce, and much more. I still think about that dinner
                     to this day. There was cake too of course, and lots of dancing. The flooring squares they had laid out on the sand to make up the dance floor actually lit up! Once everyone had torn up that dance floor they moved on to the nightclub on-site. We
                     headed off to bed at this point but heard it was a lot of fun and they played great music!

                  <h2>Activities</h2>
                  <p>We had a few days before and after the official wedding
                     day to explore. We of course spent much of that time swimming in one of the two pools available
                     and taking advantage of the complimentary swim up bar at each. There were many people walking along the 
                     beach selling different items and services. I had wanted to get my hair braided before coming on the trip
                     but didn't have the time, so I was so excited when a braider approached me about getting my hair done. 
                     While we were lounging around we ran into a couple of girls from the UK a few times, and a few days before we were due to head back
                     to the US they found us so that they could give us the excursion that they paid for but missed the pick 
                     up on the day of. They were leaving the next morning so they weren't able to go themselves and wanted to make sure 
                     that it didn't go to waste. They also wanted nothing from us for it except for the promise that we would 
                     actually go! We hadn't considered venturing off of the resort grounds, but we are so glad that we did! The next morning we woke up early 
                     and spent the day at an adventure park called Scape Park. They had animals to see, watering holes to swim in, and ziplining through the trees as well
                     as over one of the pools! It was the most fun time ever (even if we did get a bit sick after this..Warning to you, reader, 
                     DO NOT fall for the sausage pizza in the DR even if it's the only real food available at the time.).

                  <h2>Gallery</h2>
                  <p>Here are some more pictures from the trip that didn't make it into the sections above. If you ever have an opportunity,
                     you should definitely try to take a trip of your own! It was truly gorgeous and I hope to go back sometime.

                  <h2 id="mainHeading">Destination Wedding</h2>
                  <p>In the spring of 2023, I had the honor of attending a wedding in the Dominican Republic.<br> My best friend's cousin that he had grown 
                  up with since childhood was marrying his highschool sweetheart!<br> On the day of the ceremony it actually rained,
                  and although that may immediately be seen as a bad thing, I've<br>heard it can mean good luck for the couple. One of my favorite reasonings for this 
                  is that it signals that the marriage will last <br>because when a tied knot gets wet it becomes extremely difficult to untie. So, when you "tie the knot" on a rainy day, your marriage will be difficult to unravel.
                  All in all, it was a beautiful ceremony as well as a wonderful vacation.<br><br> I am still incredibly grateful that we were able to attend and
                  celebrate their union, so I wanted to share some of the highlights.

                  <p> Having never been out of the country before this trip, I was glad for the travel planning help we received from the travel <br>agent &amp; wedding coordinator. He took a lot of 
                     stress off by setting up the room reservations at the resort and the arrangements for us<br> to be taken to the resort once we landed at the Punta Cana airport.
                     All we had to do was send payment to the coordinator<br> and make sure that we had valid passports in hand before our departure.

                     <p>
                     We flew American Airlines to get both to and from the Dominican Republic. There were no flight delays and although we had a <br>couple of connecting flights that had 
                     us bustling through the airport to get to the next gate, it was relatively stress free. We left the KCI airport at 6a, caught a connecting flight in Chicago, and arrived
                     in Punta Cana at 4:45p. We exited the plane on the tarmac <br>(like movie stars!) and caught a shuttle bus to the front doors of the airport.

                     <p>
                     Once we finally made it through the longest line of my life, also known as customs, we had to find the shuttle bus that would be taking us to our resort. The company was called Discova
                     and everyone that helped us so kind. They grabbed our bags for us and moved us swiftly through the crowd while telling jokes and making sure we were comfortable. They also helped us get checked in at the front desk once we got to Dreams.

                  <p>The resort that the wedding was held at had 2 different accomodation options to choose from. There was a more expensive side that catered to adult couples and singles
                     called Secrets Royal Beach, but it cost quite a bit more. The second option was actually connected to the Secrets side and was focused more toward families, but had slightly different areas accessible to those who chose to stay there.
                     We stayed on this side, referred to as Dreams Royal Beach, and it was still quite nice! There was only restaurant that we weren't able to access and some areas of the grounds that were restricted for the guests who stayed in the Secrets rooms.

                     The room came with 2 cozy Queen size beds and a living room area with a couch in front of a TV. There was even a bathtub outside on the terrace and thankfully a full walk in shower safely inside the confines of the room's bathroom.
                     There was a buffet with an assortment of food at breakfast, lunch, and dinner as well as a handful of restaurants with cuisine ranging from Hibachi to Italian to Rotisserie Chicken so there was something for everyone. My personal favorite was the 
                     beach hut that served cheese fries...in front of the ocean...talk about paradise!

                     The cermony was held in a large courtyard on the Secrets side, and although it rained, it was still beautiful. Mostly due to all the kind words, promises, and love that was being shared under the alter. 
                     Afterward, we all went to a private section of the Secrets beach for the reception. They had salmon, veggies, hollandaise sauce, and much more. There was cake too of course, and lots of dancing. 
                     The flooring squares they had laid out on the sand to make up the dance floor actually lit up!

                  <p>We had a few days before and after the official wedding day to explore. We spent a lot of that time 
                     hanging out on the beach or swimming in one of the two pools available
                     and taking advantage of the complimentary swim up bar at each.

                     There were many people walking along the beach selling different items and services. I had wanted to get my hair braided before coming on the trip
                     but didn't have the time, so I was so excited when a braider approached me about getting my hair done.

                     While we were lounging around we ran into two girls from the UK a few times and spoke briefly. A couple of days before we were due to head back
                     to the US they found us so that they could give us the excursion that they paid for, but missed the pick 
                     up on the day of. They were leaving the next morning so they weren't able to go themselves and wanted to make sure 
                     that it didn't go to waste. They also wouldn't take anything from us for it except for the promise that we would 
                     actually go! 
                     </p>

                     We hadn't considered venturing off of the resort grounds, but we are so glad that we did. The next morning we woke up early 
                     and spent the day at an adventure park called Scape Park. They had animals to see, watering holes to swim in, and ziplining through the trees as well
                     as over one of the pools! It was the most fun time ever.
